        "bio": "Ever since Sam was a child, he has been fascinated by media, especially the area of graphic design. His passion for graphic design came from his love for music, album artwork is something that he has always looked into in depth. Thanks to studying media at GCSE, AS-level and BTEC, Sam acquired a wide range of knowledge when it comes to all things media. This allowed him to proceed into a degree in contemporary media, design and production, which he is currently in his third and final year of. With graphic design being his main interest he spends a lot of time drawing musicians and his partner digitally on programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Studying media at both college and degree levels, Sam has accumulated skills in programs such as 3DS Max and Synth Eyes, as well as other Adobe CC programmes like After Effects, Premiere Pro and Dreamweaver. Whether or not a project he is undertaking is labelled as graphic design, Sam’s work is mainly inspired by his love for music and art. He believes, that if something carries meaning or raises question, then that is art.",
